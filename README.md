# SM0SBL_remote_straight_key

This repository contains a client to allow CW using a remote rig with preserved key timing.
Togeather with the SM0SBL_remote_straight_key_server it workes as an exteded cable to the rig. To be able to keep the exact timing of the key on the local side there is a delay introduced to manage varying delays of the network.
The introduced delay is normally arount 100-200mS in my experience when using a 4G cellular network at the remote rig.
